# student-dropout
This repository presents a data science project focused on predicting student dropout risks using machine learning techniques. The workflow includes comprehensive data preprocessing, exploratory analysis, feature engineering, and training of classification models to identify students at risk of leaving their studies prematurely. The project leverages academic, demographic, and socioeconomic features, with the goal of helping educational institutions proactively address factors leading to student attrition.

### Key features:

    End-to-end Jupyter Notebook for data analysis and model development.

    Employs multiple classification algorithms to optimize prediction accuracy and interpretability.

    Documentation and data included for reproducibility.
